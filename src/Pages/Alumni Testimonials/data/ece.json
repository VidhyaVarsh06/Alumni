        "testimonial": "A determined person capable of learning and adapting to new technology within a short span of time. I take the privilege of representing the 2010-2014 batch of Electronics and Communication Engineering Department Student. I would like to begin with Professors – everyone has their own specific manner of taking classes and I totally enjoyed listening to those classes. Their mentoring system was very effective. The manner in which Professors guided me to confront every semester was an incredible experience and they were agreeable. Discussing about the industrial visits, I got the freedom to visit industries and those were useful to learn things practically. They conducted various project and paper presentation activities apart from our regular activities which increased my intention towards presenting new ideas. I have been part of Department Symposium, Cultural days, and hostel day which I enjoyed a lot in the College Campus. I can say firmly that Department teachers provided sufficient information and certainty to confront many testing things in my day-to-day life. The campus was top in providing numerous facilities for both curricular and co-curricular activities. The resources and staff members I got in Sairam were perhaps the best thing that happened in my life since we are still maintaining the same bond and they are guiding me during my critical circumstances. Finally, I thank all Professors who made me achieve many things and reach higher levels in my life. Proud to be a Sairamite!!",

The four years of college life will remain as the most astonishing part of our lives. We were very happy and made the best from my friends and had a very enjoyable time at college. As an event manager of TEDx Sairam, under the theme 'inventing innovations,' I had the responsibility of finding speakers and organizing the entire event, taking care of every minute detail. This gave me a big platform to work in a team and also helped me explore my leadership and communication skills. The development from academia to industry was achieved by my Professors, staff, and management. They acted as an emotional support, equipping us with the skills needed to face the real world. We didn't understand it at the time, but even the rules and guidelines, which seemed daunting then, turned out to be beneficial in our professional lives. They taught us the importance of career and guided us to move forward. It is a great pleasure to have continuous contact with them, and they still help make my dreams come true. Thanks to all.",

        "testimonial": "My Department nurtured me with technical skills – theoretical and practical which I enjoyed. Every subject that I learnt at Sairam ECE has helped me further my career at various stages. When I look back at the things that I have been doing at work, it all strikes back on how relevant the skills are. People find it funny to say how their education does not help them in real life but I would gladly get into that debate any day. I enjoyed my lab sessions in particular – the amount of learning that came from the hands-on and from documenting the results cannot easily be quantified – but trust me it is immense. Amongst numerous other things, I would absolutely thank my department for empowering and encouraging me to pursue new things. Be it paper presentations, quizzes, sports, adzaps, or dumb-charades – the Department encouraged and allowed me in various pursuits. It helped widen my exposure, awareness, interests, and horizons. When I now look back and recollect all the great memories of my 4 years at Sairam, it is filled with great nuggets of precious moments and whatever little negative experiences that might have happened never come up. So if you have any such gloomy days – remember that when you look back at it one day it will fade in significance compared to the good times and massive lifelong learning. When I thank my Department and the college for all the learning, my gratitude would not be complete without thanking the college for providing me the ecosystem to foster long-lasting close friendships without which my journey would never be complete.",
