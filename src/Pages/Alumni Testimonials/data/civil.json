        "testimonial": "Graduating from Sairam Institutions has helped me shape my character and strengthened attitude required to deliver strong results in industry. My four years in the Civil Department were one of my best experiences I ever had. It gave me exposure to various extra-curricular activities along with great academics. It provided all the facilities and encouragement needed to attain high in life. Looking back, I can see my department was extremely important and a stepping stone in my career. It allowed me to develop my interpersonal skills, which are extremely important in any field of work. What made Sairam Institutions special is probably the people who were there with you. We were different in many ways: cultures, religions â€“ but that did not stop us from making friends and being there for each other. Once we left the college, what we could take away with us are only the memories we share and the friendships that would last for many years to come and of course, a now thriving Alumni community. Proud to be a Sairamate.",
