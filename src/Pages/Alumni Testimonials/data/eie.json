The faculty were always of great support during the times students struggled with their courses offering personal attention. The college also had good rapport with the corporate world that brought in job opportunities. It was more helpful for the students from various branches in finding opportunities/internships in the core industries and also help in training for GATE examinations. The College is currently encouraging students to prepare for competitive exams like GRE, IELTS etc which is greatly appreciated. Best wishes to the team of professors and the support faculty. Many thanks for reaching out.",

In spite of a coin having two sides, our college has been a key to growth in career and personal attitude.",
